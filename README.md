My first Web App from scratch, using JavaScript, Html, Css, React, Typescript, Bootstrap.

The App features authentication Login and a Database for storing user Profile and Workouts using FireBase.

The app was originaly created using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML & CSS, before being upgraded to use React & BootStrap.
